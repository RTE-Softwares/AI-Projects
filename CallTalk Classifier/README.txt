Audio Transcription and Classification Tool
This code provides a Python script for an audio transcription and classification tool that utilizes the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo language model. It transcribes audio recordings into text and classifies them based on the conversation content. Below is an overview of the key components and functionalities of this code:

Components

1. OpenAI Integration: This script integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model for natural language processing. You will need to provide your OpenAI API key in the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY for authentication.

2. Audio Transcription: The tool takes an audio file as input and utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe the audio into text. The resulting transcript is obtained and stored.

3. Text-Based Conversation: The script simulates a conversation template between two people (person1 and person2). It uses this template to provide context for the transcription.

4. Chat OpenAI Model: It leverages the ChatOpenAI model for generating responses and interactions based on the provided conversation and transcript.

5. Memory Handling: The script uses a conversation buffer memory to maintain the chat history and context across interactions.

   	Usage

To use this tool:

1. Set up your environment variables by loading them from a .env file, including your OpenAI API key.

2. Run the script, which will prompt you to provide a path to an audio recording for transcription.

3.The audio will be transcribed into text using OpenAI's Whisper model.

4. The script will then simulate a conversation context and use the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to generate responses and interactions based on the provided conversation and transcript.

5. The output will be displayed, providing insights and context for the transcribed audio.

Requirements

1. Python environment with the necessary dependencies, including OpenAI Python .


This code can be further customized and integrated into applications or pipelines for automated audio transcription and classification tasks.
